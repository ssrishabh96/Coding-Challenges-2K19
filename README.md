# Coding-Challenges-2K19
Creating this repo with the idea to improve programming skills and coding style. Because yeah why not. Problem sources could include leetcode, hackerrank, topcoder and others.

I will be updating the index of the programs as I complete them with links to the question.


Index:
1. Reverse Integer (Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)
2. String to Integer (Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)
3. Prime numbers using Divison method & Sieve of Eratosthenes method
4. Finding Factors of a number
5. Prime factorization of a number 
6. Euclid's algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers
7. Program to compute the area of the polygon where each vertex is a Point with an x and y coordinate
